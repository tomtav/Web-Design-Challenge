# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude vs X)

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To
accomplish this analysis, I first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a data set of
over 500 cities.

### Analysis
After assembling the dataset, I used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude.
Factors I looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the
source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions
of any trends and correlations witnessed.
